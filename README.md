# mariadb-udf-blog

This blog post is live on MariaDB's website:
<https://mariadb.org/writing-user-defined-functions-in-rust/>

A quick blog post about how to use the [`udf`](https://github.com/pluots/sql-udf)
crate to create MariaDB/MySQL user-defined functions.

The blog's text source is located in `rust-udf-blog.md`, and the final
source code for the example is in `test-udf.
